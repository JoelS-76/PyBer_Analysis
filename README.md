# PyBer_Analysis

## Overall Purpose

Isolate and analyze the ride sharing data for Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities respectively. This will help the decision-makers at PyBer better understand how to allocate resources for the company.

## Comparison of data from different city types

### Urban
The Urban cities, unsurprisingly, have by far the highest fare totals, the highest ride count, and the highest driver count. Urban areas have more residents who don't own cars and require more options for transportation. They also, of course, have a higher population. Urban cities accounted for nearly 63% of the total fares, making it by far the most profitable type (see fig. 5 below). It makes sense for PyBer to allocate a higher proportion of its resources on Urban settings.

### Suburban and Rural
Suburban areas, since they are much more car-reliant, will naturally bring less revenue to PyBer than urban. Nevertheless, they are still a valuable segment of the business, accounting for nearly a third of the fares and over a quarter of the total rides (see fig. 6 below).

The Rural cities presently account for only 6.8% of fares and 5.3% of rides. However, both the Rural and Suburban cities need more drivers. Only 2.6% of the drivers are out in rural areas (see fig. 7 below). The fare, ride, and driver percentages don't need to be exactly the same, but it would help if they were closer. It is not desirable for the ride percentage to double the driver percentage. This will cause long delays in answering customer calls, potentially leading to lost business and customer goodwill. In terms of percentages, Suburban cities aren't quite as bad off, but 26% of rides to 16% of drivers is not close enough.

## Analysis of Summary Data

The above chart shows the comparison of total fares for each city type from January through April of 2019. As you can see, the lines do not intersect. In spite of the obvious need for drivers in other areas, it is clear that Urban cities are and will remain the most important revenue base for PyBer. What is significant, however, is that the drivers in urban cities also pull in much less in fares per ride than their suburban and rural counterparts:

If PyBer can incentivize working in rural areas for some of its urban drivers, it is likely that they would see more business and more customers in those areas, maintaining customer satisfaction and goodwill. I would keep the percentage of drivers a little lower than the percentage of rides, so that the rural average fare per driver doesn't go down too much. But by siphoning off some urban drivers to other areas, the urban fare per driver should increase. This way, PyBer can maximize the rural and suburban areas, where there are fewer rides but more revenue per ride, and improve work conditions and satisfaction for the urban drivers by increasing their average fares.

## Action items

-Incentivize working in rural and suburban areas

-Rotate some urban drivers to those areas

-Recruit and hire more drivers in rural areas in particular, also in suburbs

-Offer deals on long trips with expensive parking for rural and suburban drivers (such as trips to the airport) so as to build a larger customer base in those cities.
